Preparations
Before you distribute a module you should do the following:
1. Ensure that the module is in the public domain, or
2. Ensure that you have appropriate permission from the copyright holder to distribute the work.
It is possible that your proposed new user module is already available in the official library of the program
found at www.theword.net. Depending on the quality of your modules, it is possible that your module will
be considered for inclusion at the official site, if you wish so. The quality of a module depends on many
things, such as its content, whether it has an understandable and logical structure, and the consistency of
the formatting, amongst other things. Whether or not this is the case, it would be good to send an email to
root@theword.net, to ask whether or not that particular work is currently available from another source or is
being worked on by someone else. Before you consider the possibility of writing a module yourself, it is a
very good idea to get familiar with existing modules in TW5. Working with existing modules will better help
you to understand all the aspects that characterize a good-quality module.

-  Contact by email: you may ask a question by sending an email to mailto:help@theword.net. Please, notice that direct emails are answered with low priority, especially if the same information can be found on the forum or in the FAQ section. Please, use this means only as a last resort and if you are still unable to find an answer to your question.
